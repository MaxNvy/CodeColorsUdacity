# Code Colors by nvy

This is a portfolio blueprint created using the "Learn CSS and HTML" tutorial provided by Udacity.

## Technologies Used

This theme uses Bootstrap 3 and 4
it also uses HTML and CSS for the content and styling.

    Bootstrap necessities include:
    - Javascript
    - JQuery
    - Popper

## Inspiration

The Theme is inspired by the various colors of code that people toss together for their viewing pleasure.

The theme follows the mockup project provided during the Udacity course  "HTML / CSS Introduction".  I completed the course for a dive into Bootstrap.

## Take aways

My main takeaway from this effort is that I can do it.  Using Bootstrap instead of just coding a page out by "hand" has not made sense to me until now.  I've not understood its power or felt its time saving ingenuity because (being a novice) my projects with Bootstrap were taking longer than just coding something i already know what I'm doing.
